# Beginner Financial Analysis Projects in Python

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly financial analysis projects. Each project is designed to be completed using Python in a Google Colab environment, leveraging freely available data and common data science libraries. The goal is to build foundational skills in quantitative finance, programming, and data analysis.

As I complete each project, I will upload the corresponding Google Colab notebook (`.ipynb` file) to this repository.

## Core Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
* **yfinance** for historical stock data
* **pandas-datareader** for economic data from FRED
* **statsmodels** & **Scikit-learn** for statistical analysis
